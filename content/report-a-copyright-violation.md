## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ &nbsp;Report a copyright violation

[![Copyright violation](https://img.shields.io/badge/copyright-violation-red?style=flat)](https://github.com/tit8/polimi-elettronica/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Copyright&template=report-violazione-di-copyright.md)

You have two options for reporting copyright violations:

1. **Guided Report Issue on GitHub:** If you have a GitHub account, you can report copyright violations using our guided reporting issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/tit8/polimi-elettronica/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Copyright&template=report-violazione-di-copyright.md). This system is designed to help you provide the minimum necessary information effectively.

2. **Via Email:** You can also report violations by sending us an email. Please refer to our [contact page]({{< ref "contact.md#e-mail-us" >}}) to reach us. In your email, make sure to provide a meaningful description of the violation. Include details such as the file that violates the copyright or license, whether you are the owner, and any other relevant information.

Feel free to choose the option that works best for you. Your assistance in reporting copyright violations is greatly appreciated.
